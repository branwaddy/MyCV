    <p>
      I am 23 years old and completed my Matric in 2016. I studied music performance and production in London at the London College of Creative Media
      from 2017 to 2019. I started developing a passion for code design in late 2019 and recently have been lucky enough to be able to formally study it at the
    coding school HyperionDev.</p>

    <p>I feel that my passion for music gives me a unique perspective on software engineering, such as being able to creatively solve problems. I am motivated
      to develop a unique brand of work ethic known for my ambition and creativity and learn to combine my passion for music and passion for code.
